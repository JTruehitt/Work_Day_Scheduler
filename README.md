# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
In this challenge, I was tasked with building an application that allows a user to save events to their workday schedule. The users entered info is saved in local storage and is displayed each time the user returns to the page. Additionally, I built in functionality to allow the user to clean individual items, or clear the entire page at once. 

Throughout building this application, I furthered my knowledge and developed new skills in the following topics:
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and traversal
- Bootstrap for page layout and utility classes
- Day.js for tapping into current date/time and using this to display content conditionally 
- jQuery .each loops to apply functions to multiple elements at once
- Storing, retrieving, and deleting items in local storage
- Utilizing JSON to stringify and parse data
- Utilizing currentTarget vs target on event listeners to overcome event bubbling
- Using setInterval to update the current time each second
